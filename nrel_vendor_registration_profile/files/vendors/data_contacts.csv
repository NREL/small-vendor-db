The rating system is unique online platform called Supplier Share.  It allows a member to rate suppliers they have done business with and search for quality suppliers they are considering doing business with.  This environment promotes the sharing of quality suppliers throughout various industries and holds each supplier accountable to deliver a quality product or service.  Suppliers benefit from continuing to provide excellence, and encouraging their clients to rate them in the system.
 
Supplier Classification System
The classification system is called Supplier Class.  This concept is not new.  Our uniqueness comes from our ability to provide accuracy to the process.  BDG’s approach is to capture supplier profile information directly from the client’s suppliers and not from unsubstantiated third party resources.  This approach may provide the supplier with more opportunities via classification identification, and positions the client to feel comfortable about the accuracy of the diversity numbers being reported.  This online system makes available to its clients various options such as the ability to reference the actual profile completed by the supplier, copies of certification documents, standardized tier-2 reporting, and a buyer tracking process.

Supplier Diversity Development:
BeeHive Diversity Group seeks out companies looking to improve their supplier diversity program.  We work with individuals involved in shaping company direction and executing company protocol.  Each of our employees are committed to working with you, our customer, to build a program that is company driven, consumer focused and that defines a model of excellence in the corporate community and beyond.

The Optima resource network is loaded with technical, functional and development resources from all over the country, with experience in designing, deploying and maintaining Oracle 11i ERP, CRM and database solutions.  Our specialty is in finding the expert in a sea of consulting mediocrity, helping our customers further leverage their existing Oracle investment.  We are generally able to turn things around quickly, due to our relationships within the industry and our reputation for treating customers and consultants with respect.  Our quick turn around is our niche, due to our ability to replicate the search and interview components of our solution.

The Optima Resource Services team also provides resource roadmaps for those customers who are in the design phase of developing an enterprise application management solution, to help elucidate service level and staffing requirements for the rollout and on going support of Oracle applications and technology.  We are always available for our customers, to leverage ideas and or strategies upon, so that we can jointly come up with a solution that meets business objectives, while ensuring solution supportability.

Our business partners are treated with the same level of respect as our customers are, which is why Optima resources service has been so successful in retaining both customers and consultants.  We view our business partnerships as an extension of Optima, and focus on partners that view opportunities as long term relationships, as opposed to those vendors that have a more myopic transactional perspective.

Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) is a collection of disciplines used to help organizations turn ideas into software in a cost-effective and predictable way. While ALM has been instrumental in making software development projects more successful over the past twelve years, statistics show there is still room for improvement. Current ALM tools are discipline-centric and have process, data, and role silos, which don’t work well in today’s application development organizations. Organizations, too, have functional, technological, and geographic silos. Better ALM practices and tools should help break down these silos and contribute to even more successful software projects. These ALM 2.0 tools should be role-focused, with functional components brought together in a process-centric interoperability framework. Serena’s ALM products are already delivering on the promise of ALM 2.0, with organizations worldwide deploying and utilizing them successfully.
Serena is also leading the efforts to create an open-source ALM interoperability framework through the Eclipse foundation.

Because our extraordinarily diverse team contains deep expertise in a wide range of organizational disciplines in numerous industries around the world, we are able to tailor our consultation and training to carefully fit our clients' organizational issues, business sector, and demographic profile. 

Our most popular services include strategic planning, large-scale change, Appreciative Inquiry, Polarity Management ™, executive coaching, team-development, intergroup and cross-cultural team building, organizational assessment, conflict management, cultural integration in mergers and acquisitions, a remarkable program for developing corporate innovation and entrepreneurship, and an extensive curriculum of widely benchmarked diversity training programs and development strategies. We primarily deliver our services on site, and design virtual training and facilitation on request.  

The philosophy we employ is highly appreciative and purposefully positive, to celebrate and leverage the strengths of the organization and it's people. We help our clients focus on generative and creative forces in their organizations, such as employee retention, customer satisfaction, and cross-cultural synergy, rather than choosing to only focus on deficits such as employee turnover, customer complaints, miscommunications/conflicts. Our work is grounded in broad systems thinking, theory, and practice, such that we approach all of our work with the intent to improve the overall functioning of the larger organization as well as to assist business units, teams, and individuals with specific development.

2007 – Instructor/Computer Networking and Security
Chubb Institute
Springfield, PA

I have taught Cisco security, Network security, Introduction to Linux, Advanced Linux, and I expect to teach Windows Server 2003, and Windows Exchange Server this fall, starting in October. The school itself focuses on preparing the student for certification exams but also offers an Associate’s degree option.

1996 – 2006 Instructor/Educational Specialist IV/ Math & Computer Science
Mercer County Community College
Trenton, New Jersey 08604
 
 I have worked several part time position here all related to either math or computer science. I have just completed a Computer Literacy course for the Donnelly housing project, which was a community outreach effort of the college’s Project Smile. By Computer literacy it should be understood to mean the use of Win XP  and the Microsoft Office suite. I am currently teaching High Math and a SAT preparation segment and also I’m scheduled to conduct a Literacy training program designed to upgrade the skills of a selected group of students.

I have spoken with Nick Dean regarding doing a side by side evaluation or our Avaya Telephone Equipment and the Cisco Equipment he mentioned being piloted now by NREL.  I wanted to make sure I followed the proper channels as well which is why I am registering on this site.  We are a women owned business and I realize the NREL likes to work with Small, Underprivledged and women owned businesses.  
Thank you for your consideration.

Dear Nick,

Thank you so much for your time on the phone this morning.  As I mentioned we would be happy to provide demonstration systems of the Avaya VOIP products for you to test along side the Cisco pilot you are currently testing.  I appreciate your candor and wish to apologize on behalf of our business partner for not getting back to you right away.  

I appreciate you allowing me to introduce VanRan to NREL.  We were established in 1986 as a female-owned company, VanRan is an Authorized Avaya Business Partner and AT&T Agent.  Our primary goal is tailoring overall system solutions to satisfy customer needs, both present and future, utilizing the latest in technology and cost effective solutions.  We offer complete PBX systems, parts, upgrades, installation, monitoring and maintenance.
  
VanRan has been representing Bell Labs/AT&T/Lucent and Avaya for the past 21 years.  As one of Avaya’s Business partners we bring over 1000 years combined technical expertise to Avaya customers.  Our technical staff consists of former Avaya, AT&T and Lucent engineers and designers.  We are recognized for our depth of knowledge and hands on experience in designing, installing and maintaining complex systems.  The fact that the new AT&T uses us for their designs, implementations and maintenance for their Avaya customers attests to that claim.  

A few of VanRan’s Denver based customers include; The State of Colorado, Pro-Build Holdings and the Auraria Campus.

I hope to have the opportunity to show you how VanRan, with our prompt response and attention to detail and design stands out in the world of Avaya Business Partners.  Thank you again for your consideration.

They introduced cutting-edge technology with the development of the first US patented catalyst to destroy volatile organic compounds (VOCs).  CCC has a diversified foundation with four major divisions: Catalyst, Environmental, Industrial, and Advanced BioEnergy. The entire company is supported by a multi-disciplined engineering staff and a 24/7 service department. 

Industrial Division
The Industrial Division designs, assembles, installs, starts up and services major air pollution control systems such as regenerative thermal oxidizers (RTOs) and Zeolite wheel rotary concentrators for a wide variety of industrial applications.   Our role is to provide customers with state of the art technology required to meet and exceed regulatory requirements such as MACT and BACT for the capture and destruction of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC’s).

 Environmental Division
The Environmental Division designs, manufactures, shop tests, starts up and services standard and custom thermal and catalytic oxidizer systems used for site remediation. These projects include soil vapor extraction, dual phase and multi-phase extraction, groundwater pump and treat and air stripper projects. Contaminants frequently include BTEX, MTBE and TBA. CCC offers electric and fuel gas fired designs in a wide range of capacity. 
Our clients include the major oil companies and numerous engineering and consulting companies that focus on the environmental industry.

Catalyst Division
The Catalyst Division features a portfolio of precious metal based catalyst products that we develop, manufacture and supply to the food service, stationary engine, wire enamel, remediation and air pollution control industries. We also develop custom catalysts for special applications like fuel cells and nuclear power recombination of hydrogen gas. Toll coating and catalyst cleaning are also services we offer.
The Appliance Division provides wire mesh, ceramic or metal foil substrate precious metal based catalysts to reduce smoke and odor from self cleaning ovens. With the input from the engineering departments of leading appliance manufacturers, we are able to design; manufacture and supply vent tubes for their various models of ranges and ovens. 
 
Advanced BioEnergy Division
The role of the Advanced BioEnergy Division is to synthesize research, experience and future outlook to create a big picture as it relates to progression and development of new business units. Critical to this path is the need to become familiar with what customers and consumers need and to remain aware of what competitors are doing in the marketplace.  The Division evaluates the benefits, risks, and future implications of CCC’s ideas and that of others.  The ability to visualize potential by leveraging existing core competencies is a critical aspect in managing risk exposure.

Alexandria, VA, July 7 - GAITS, Inc., announced today that it has successfully completed transition activities for over 200 Q and L-cleared IT professionals in conjunction with its recently awarded Department of Energy contract at Sandia National Laboratories. The transition was completed seamlessly within 30 days, with broad-based IT support operations now underway in both Albuquerque, NM, and Livermore, CA.

Tom Asefi, GAITS President, stated that the completion of the transition in the 30 day timeframe was particularly noteworthy given that GAITS had the additional task of selecting a new health insurance carrier as part of the transition. Mr. Asefi said: ""With our online employee portal, we were able to quickly obtain census data on the employees, submit Requests for Proposals to several carriers, obtain and evaluate proposals, and select the one carrier that best serves our expanded employee base. These steps were all completed while concurrently maintaining excellent progress with overall transition activities. As a result we achieved 100% customer satisfaction during this period.""

GAITS also used a transition program management portal based on the Microsoft Sharepoint software to facilitate knowledge sharing among the transition team, which was led by Randy Randazzo, GAITS Sr. Vice President. GAITS immediately established a local office in Albuquerque, NM, consisting of recruiters and HR specialists with deep experience, including specific experience supporting Sandia operations. The transition team conducted orientation sessions on site and held individual meetings with employees to discuss specific needs and situations. Further, the transition team implemented the proven GAITS recruiting process to fill certain high-priority openings immediately, before the end of the transition period. All employees under this contract hold DOE security clearances at various levels. The employees were recruited or transitioned from 11 incumbent contractors, and the consolidated contract for GAITS represents a significant efficiency improvement for Sandia management.

AttentionIT is an Information Technology firm with over twenty years of personnel experience in providing software application solutions for the environmental waste management industry. Our software, eMWaste® was originally developed addressing the basic management and tracking functions associated with environmental waste by recording the profiling, generation, inventory, processing, treatment, movement, shipping, disposal, and reporting of the waste. Since then eMWaste® has gone beyond the original scope to include additional module offerings that are integrated in the base software and designed to save the customer money and time.

Integrated with our technology offerings is our state-of-the-art hosting option. We provide a hosting option for companies that don’t have the resources to house a database server. Our 24X7 hosting facility has biometric access, backup power, fire suppressant qualities, and sits on a highly secure internet backbone in Charlotte, NC. Let AttentionIT worry about your database administration and backups.

In addition to the services listed above, we offer consulting on workflow management, software application design and development, barcode and RFID implementation, and task management. We are resellers of Symbol® technology equipment and provide programming for barcode scanners.

R & D Prototype brings a broad range of experience with our full service approach to product development. We are a multi-disciplinary design and prototyping firm focused on creating and enhancing new products and business opportunities through product design and engineering, prototyping, bridge tooling, and reverse engineering. 

At R & D Prototype, we utilize several prototyping methods to insure our customers are provided with the best solution to meet their needs. We use only the latest, high-precision technologies to make objects that range in size from as small as 0.010"" diameter to as large as thirty inches - even in a single piece. Whether our customers utilize our Stereolithography/SLA, urethane casting/RTV, HUB, SLS, QuickCast, or FDM services, they can be assured that the prototype they will be provided with will enable them to accurately evaluate the actual physical aesthetics, size and function of a product that had only been previously viewed in two dimensional methods. They can also test the fit and function of individual components into an assembly - whether a very complex assembly or a specific fit - often in materials that accurately mimic the finished product. 
Besides this, we offer a wide variety of high quality finishes for every budget with different kinds of paints and special touches like translucent frosting inside bottles or water clear prototypes (even bottles finished to clarity inside and out). Whether a strip and ship, bead-blasted part or a smooth, high gloss finish or somewhere in between, our finished products deliver the high quality our customers deserve. In addition, R & D Prototype has become a one-stop-shop for our clients by offering a variety of high quality services through our specialied sister companies. In addition to prototyping technologies, we offer silicone molding; machining of aluminum, ABS, and other materials; laser scanning for reverse engineering; laser marking and 3d engraving; composite tooling masters; and injection, blow, IBM, and silicone injection molding. 

Yet we aspire to deliver even more. We want to offer our customers the ""Total Product Creation"" experience. Providing the entire scope of a project, or any part thereof, securely and confidentially. We felt it was necessary to offer an expanded range of services to take your concepts from ideation to completion. The result will help propel your products into this highly competitive marketplace with a distinct advantage.

(1) Before purchasing an item of supply listed in the FPI Schedule, conduct market research to determine whether the FPI item is comparable to supplies available from the private sector that best meet the Government’s needs in terms of price, quality, and time of delivery. This is a unilateral determination made at the discretion of the contracting officer. The arbitration provisions of 18 U.S.C. 4124(b) do not apply.

Our company started in June 2001 and we currently have offices in Houston, Denver, Oklahoma City, and Tulsa with a plan to open 2 to 4 new offices in 2009.  Our founders used to be buyers of the services our company now offers when they had a project based technology services company that was sold in 2000.  That collective experience from managing complex enterprise technology projects to being buyers of staff augmentation services helped form the model we employ today.

We think we set ourselves apart in the way we sell, recruit, screen, and manage our consultants.  I do not want to bore you with traditional ""company speech"" and I am confident a conversation with one of our clients or consultants would communicate that we are very good at what we do and how we do it.

UMI-2000 is a supplier of Activated Carbon, Ion Exchange Resins and Adsorption Filter Vessels.  We are a small business in a HUB Zone.  We would like to do business with NREL and supply these products and services for your Environmental Engineering projects.  We have over 52 standard models of Activated Carbon Adsorbers to choose from and can also custom build Adsorbers from CS, SS, HDPE, FRP etc.  (You will find our pricing and service very competitive with Siemens, Baker, Calgon Carbon, Norit etc.).  We build all of Norit's Adsorbers.  We also rent carbon adsorbers.  Currently we have three VFV-2000 vapor phase Carbon Adsorbers on rent at the Hay Road Landfill in Vacaville CA.  We can also do carbon changeouts anywhere in the USA with regenerated or virgin GAC from coal, coconut shell, lignite, wood etc.  We also have computer programs to calculate carbon use rate estimates for both liquid and vapor phase applications.  Please keep us in mind for your Activated Carbon or Ion Exchange projects.

This approach leads to new business for DKW and satisfies our customers requirements in a timely, efficient and cost-effective manner. Our high performance teams consistently exceed customer expectations - as reflected in our exponential growth from just over $4M in sales for 2005 to a projected $22M for 2008.

We screen and qualify our candidates by more than just a list of buzzwords on a resume. We maintain very precise standards of selection which include sensitivity to corporate culture and environmental fit, background, and motivational factors. But most importantly, we recruit candidates who can prove they can do the job, by testing them thoroughly, either through an online testing system, or by a unique, client-specific test, customized precisely to fit the client’s needs.

We have very strong in-house technical knowledge. When we are working to fill a requirement we are not guessing at what the technologies in that requirement mean. As a result, we are able to speak with and screen candidates from a technical perspective, so only the most suitable candidates are considered.

Our senior level staff is highly experienced, and each member of our staff is able to address issues and answer questions, so that you enjoy a “one-call service” environment, without delays, hassles, or waiting for calls back.

Our ability to recruit the right candidate for your requirement is head-and-shoulders above our competition. We recruit using an extensive system of referrals, communication-web building, industry relationships, and our stored pipeline of candidates. We use the same job boards as most companies do, but our technical experience carries us a step further and enables us to burrow into areas of internet recruiting that most companies will never know exist. We employ combinations of traditional, specialized, and innovative recruiting strategies to bring the best fit to you in the shortest amount of time.

When you work with Streffco you are assured of ethics, integrity and a very successful team to draw ideas from and help you with decisions. You will enjoy a comfort level that speaks to our dedication to excellent customer service. Our promise of personal attention, excellence and flexibility has made us the high-quality, reliable consulting firm we are today. 

We have been operating for 20 years – continuously. Many recruiting firms closed their doors during the economic turndown several years ago. Our unique character and ability to get the job done, even in the toughest of times, has carried us through the storm and awarded us with a tenured service record you can trust.

Our Back-office system is second-to-none. We maintain a no-error back-office environment through the employment of fail-safe electronic data auditing, double-entry accounting systems, and integration of all aspects of our back-office system to ensure data integrity. Our clients and consultants are assured of accuracy – which results in savings in time and money.

I am a specialized Recruiter with NES Global.  The discipline that I specialize in is Renewable and Alternative Energy. 

NES is a global company with over 25 offices located in Europe, the Middle East, the Far East, the Americas, Canada, West Africa and Australia.  

If you have any needs for professionals in Renewable and Alternative Energy, either now or in the future, we may be able to help save you time and money.  Due to the fact that I specialize in recruiting for this industry globally, I have an established network of Renewable and Alternative Energy professionals.

NES Global offers customized services and rates to our clients and we offer guarantees on the employees' performance.  Most recruiting firms offer a ""replacement guarantee"" on direct hire employees.  We do offer that, however, we take that a step further, offering a reimbursement of the employee's first month's wages if they are not a good fit for your company.

Additionally, if you choose to employ an applicant as a contractor, NES has the capability of relocating contractors from across the globe, supporting visa and logistics at no additional cost to you as the client.  NES also provides full health, dental, short and long-term disability, and life insurance to our contractors at no additional cost to the contractor or to you as the client.

If you feel I may be of assistance to you, please contact me by telephone (numbers listed below) or send me an email.

I look forward to hearing from you.

I noticed continual staffing needs at NREL requiring fuel cell experience.  I have been recruiting in the fuel cell industry for over 8 years, primarily for engineers and researchers.  Industry professionals have noticed that Technical Staffing Professionals is the only staffing agency committed enough to the fuel cell industry to attend trade show events, including the Fuel Cell Seminar in Palm Springs this past October, and exhibited at this event in Phoenix in 2008, and in San Antonio in 2007.  We also exhibited at the Ohio Fuel Cell Coalition Symposiums: 2007 in Columbus, 2008 in Akron, and 2009 at the Stark State Campus in Canton, and at the Fuel Cells 2007 and Fuel Cells 2008 shows, in Raleigh and Rochester, respectively.  We also attended numerous other industry events including the U.S. Fuel Cell Council's Congressional Symposium and the National Hydrogen Association shows for several years.

I would like to be added to your approved vendor list and help you in attracting and hiring the talent required to help you succeed.

Here's my latest update - November 2, 2012:

I'm a creative director / graphic designer who has worked for NREL in the past.I  did provide to NREL graphic design services in 1999 and 2000. Specifically for the NREL Visitors Center. I worked with Grace Griego and Kerry Masson.

For NREL's Visitor’s Center, there was a need to educate and promote the use of renewable energy to kids ages 8 to 18. To encourage these tours to the center, I designed large format graphics and with small space advertising in promoting biomass, wind and solar energy technology.

I would like to work again for NREL in producing print collateral, digital advertising and web design. I'm very comfortable working in-house in a collaborative environment and on the outside as well. I'm available to NREL's Communications / Marketing Services needs. I would look forward again for the opportunity to produce successful work for NREL's various market communities. 

I'm based in Denver, CO.

As a solution focused Executive Search Firm these last 13 years, Entente Consulting is dedicated to helping Research and Technology companies build out teams of exceptional talent. We assist Green Technology, Renewable Energy and complementary industries in placing executive, engineering, research, administrative, sales, marketing and operations professionals. 

Our Services:
We know most companies have an excellent internal HR team for meeting their staffing requirements. But we also know there comes a time particularly during peak ramp up periods, that it's good to have an outside firm to help supplement your efforts. Someone who effectively searches from a fresh perspective to help free up your time for other priorities. Someone who is well connected in your industry who approaches recruitment with the same integrity and care as you do. That's Entente. We've been in your position, and we understand. We're here to help you solve your biggest challenges and most difficult hires by providing the best candidate and client experience through the whole hiring process.
 
As such, our contingency recruiting service is designed to identify, qualify, and present senior candidates for positions to our clients for a fee (TBD). Please contact me on working within your terms and additional information.

Our current models of the Catalyst Combustion System (CCS) are DC-103 and DC-203 with other delivery systems in development.  The catalyst is a mixture of metals typically found in a catalytic converter; therefore, the catalytic converter chemistry takes place in the combustion chamber.  Carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) are reduced largely eliminating unburned hydrocarbons (UHC), which have been converted to useful energy in the engine.
 
Exhaust Emissions Testing Results on a Detroit Diesel Series 50 diesel engine show CO reduced by 9.3%, HC by 58.3%, NOx by 13.6% and particulate matter (PM) by 42.8%.  In addition to reducing harmful emissions, the CCS has been shown in field testing to reduce fuel consumption by 8-12% in heavy duty diesel engines.  Diesel engines have an average operational life of 25 years.  CCS works in conjunction with other retrofit technologies by decreasing the engine emissions at their source.

Computational mathematics is a core, enabling technology that can be applied across almost any field of scientific research and commercial industry.  
While it may seem somewhat esoteric, here are two simple examples of how Sparsix can apply its expertise in this area to the benefit of the Department of Energy and its subcontractors:
1.	Accelerating the performance of computationally intensive applications, such as:
o	Programs that simulate complex physical systems or phenomena – anything that is described by partial differential equations.  Applications might include nuclear detonation modeling, plasma modeling, oil and gas reservoir modeling, or diffusion of hazardous materials into ground water.
o	Programs that optimize large and complex systems – anything described by linear programming or mixed integer programming.  Applications might include planning of generation resources for the national power grid, auctioning of financial transmission rights for regional power grids, or integration of renewables and micro-grids.
2.	Analyzing massive data sets or real-time data streams for patterns or anomalies, such as:
o	Programs that analyze data from very “noisy” environments and contain a large amount of “bad” data.  Applications might include inline inspection of oil and gas pipelines.
o	Programs that must act on quickly changing data from fast developing phenomena.  Applications might include analyzing phasor measurement unit data from the power grid to detect and respond to potentially cascading failures before they can spread.

I look forward to talking with you about how MR Colorado Springs can assist you in your recruiting efforts.

 Mark Merriman has been an Industry leader for over 25 years in recruiting for the Power Industry, primarily Electric and Gas Utilities, along with Consulting firms, ISO/RTO and Research organizations.

Mark has always been committed to this statement: “My goal with candidates is to treat them with the same respect and professionalism whether I have contacted them during a search or they have sought my assistance in reaching their career goals.  When working with my client companies, I strive to develop a partnership with them.  Only by working toward an agreed upon goal, can I identify the candidate that is a match for both the technical as well as the cultural requirements of the position.  In today’s rapidly changing energy field, my clients are seeking individuals that have a track record of success as well as a vision of the industry’s exciting future.  Regulatory and Government Affairs, Rates, Econometrics, Risk and Trading, Accounting, Operations, Environmental Health & Safety and Engineering are the areas that I work in most frequently.”

Why We Are Different

Specialization in the Energy Industry--Since 1982, this office has specialized in the Energy Field, working with major Gas and Electric Power Companies as well as Co-ops, Municipals, and firm that consult to the industry to identify and recruit top talent and difficult to find technical expertise for placement.  While many firms call themselves industry specialists, our client list and database of industry candidates is centered in energy and as such we keep abreast of industry trends, current legislation, and changing technologies that effect our companies and the kinds of talent they seek.  Emerging developments in renewable energy sources, smart grid technologies, energy efficiency and demand side management, and advances in pollution control are just a few of the challenges that drive the hiring needs of our clients.  Combined with the industry’s aging workforce and potential loss of intellectual capital, we are keenly aware of the need to attract and retain a skilled engineering and technical workforce as well as a tenured management team.

A Tenured Track Record of Success--Founded in 1982 by Jack Merriman, and now led by Senior Search Consultants, Mark Merriman and Don Dillon, the Energy Practice at MR Colorado Springs currently boasts over 47 years combined recruiting experience.  Each recruiting assignment is overseen by one of these tenured search consultants and he will act at the single point of contact throughout the search process.   We have completed hundreds of searches for our clients and annually rank near the top of our 1,000 office network.

Search Flexibility--Before beginning any search, the specific needs of the client must be examined in detail.  Whether seeking to fill an individual position or to undertake a major staffing initiative, there must be an assessment",,,2012-11-04 05:33:42.0000000

I currently provide a variety of drug and alcohol testing services for corporate and private clients.  I would be honored to provide NREL's pre-employment, post-accident, and random testing.  While we currently provide traditional lab-based testing through a variety of SAMHSA approved labs, we have just partnered with eScreen which will completely change the testing process to which you may have been accustomed.  eScreen is a web based point of collection system that allows us to run all samples right from the office.  Negative results are provided within 15 minutes of the completed test, right to your desktop.  Any non-negative result will be sent directly to the lab for positive confirmation with a turn around time of 24 hours, instead of 48-72 hours with standard lab-based testing.  Obviously this has huge implications in both the pre-employment and post-accident process.  How nice would it be to extend a job offer to a highly qualified candidate within minutes instead of days? Equally, it would be extrememly beneficial to know if impairment due to drugs or alcohol could have been the cause for an employee's accident at work.  In addition to expeditious reporting, there are no bulky chain of custody forms.  The streamlined software allows you to schedule a donor and simply print an ""e-passport"" which you send with the employee to our office.  In most instances, that is the ONLY piece of paper ever generated.  The environmental impact with this web-based system is remarkable.  I would encourage you to visit my website (www.5280drugtesting.com) to see a full list of our services and even see a few pictures of the office.  I am an RN, and when I designed my office, I did so with the professional in mind.  Drug testing can make people very anxious for a variety of reasons, but my compassionate care and attention to providing outstanding customer service is what sets me apart.  Please let me know if you would like additional information or to see a demonstration of the eScreen process.  I look forward to hearing from you.",,,2012-11-06 06:33:46.0000000

With a public relations background forged in the international infrastructure and energy industries, Parker PR offers targeted strategies that can effectively communicate your sustainable building and advanced energy messages to your ideal audiences.

We have worked with companies in our backyard and across the globe to convey the fundamental messaging behind their proven, industry-leading product, technology and service capabilities – while successfully emphasizing their delivery on the tenets of environmental responsibility.

Both our skill and our passion lie in a similar realm – telling the stories of those dedicated to building a better tomorrow.


EXPERIENCE
Parker PR is prideful of an interconnected client base that benefits from both our reputation and the reputation of the companies we work with.  Our sincere dedication to and understanding of the sustainable building and advanced energy movements has resulted in establishing relationships with like-minded organizations, and particularly those offering the truly viable solutions in today’s trend-driven sea of “all things green.” 

With a genuine interest in what our clients do, we prefer a “virtual employee” work style in which our staff assumes a deep product/service knowledge base, enabling the ability to work seamlessly alongside internal client contacts.

Building/Construction
•	Coding/listing/rating requirements (ex. AFSA, ASHRAE, ASTM, Energy Star, LEED, NAHB, NFSA, NSF, UL)  
•	Environmentally compatible chemicals (ex. Paints, coatings, cleaning products)

SUITE OF SERVICES
Whether a complete program or an independent project, our PR service offering is built on a base of longstanding relationships with the trade, business/financial and consumer media, coupled with a refined talent in implementing a suite of scalable, strategically driven service components.

We provided educational tours and charter transportation to the Society of Women Geographers Annual Meeting in Boulder to NREL last week. 

Our tour guide, James Bosch, encouraged that I register our local carbon-neutral company as a NREL vendor. He thought we would be a great fit for NREL employees and groups and visiting groups / individuals for team building; local outdoor adventure tours (hiking, bike tours, fly fishing, rock climbing, fly fishing, rafting, photography tours); Event planning services; Charter & Sightseeing Services; and Photography/Video Services.

I look forward to hearing from you and developing a successful partnership with NREL.

Our ONE price, ONE Part Number, ONE Purchase Order solution has helped numerous organizations save time, money and frustration with regards to the tool acquisition process - by taking your required tools, test equipment lists for each work group, we create unique a part number within our system allowing you to focus on the job at hand. Rather than sourcing tools, and test equipment from multiple vendors, for example, you would be able to order the NREL_GEOTHERMAL100, and that tool kit would included all the required tools needed to outfit your Geothermal technicians. Not to mention this process builds in uniformity throughout the organization, or work group. Tools are organized neatly in pallets or foam and can even be etched with personal identifiers for accountability as well to prevent Foreign Object Damage or FOD.   
I would like to schedule a time for Nancy Gardner, other representatives of NREL to come to Tecra Tools and see our facilities as we are located in Englewood, CO. Additionally, to better understand the vast needs and work groups at NREL, perhaps we could arrange a time to meet in Golden and tour the facilities. 

Thank you very much for your time and consideration. I feel given the work NREL does, there may be a good fit for NREL and Tecra Tools to partner more than we have to date. Thank you for your time and consideration.

My name is Jeni Carson and I am with Master Klean Janitorial Inc. I do all of the New Business Development for our company in the greater metro area. I am interested in being a part of the bidding process with your facility’s janitorial needs now and possibly in the future. You have several locations throughout the Metro Area and I was wondering how Master Klean might earn the opportunity to serve you? 

Our goal is to establish a long and mutually beneficial relationship with you.  

Master Klean is a locally owned and managed, full service, commercial janitorial service.  Founded in 1972, Master Klean currently cleans 16 million square feet of manufacturing, high tech, industrial, medical and office space from Greeley to Colorado Springs.  We strive to provide a clean and healthy environment in all of our buildings.

We hope that our experience and successful track record will allow us to work with your team.  Several of our accounts are complex and demanding, and Master Klean has continuously risen to the challenge of managing them.  We also anticipate our cost to provide services are at fair and competitive rates, while addressing your unique needs.

We take pride in the fact that we are one of the only vendors in the metro area that is complete with E-Verify. We insure that we are hiring people legal to work in the United States. We proactively background check each applicant for your safety and security.

Finally, Master Klean also takes pride in leading the industry as it grows and changes.  The recent movement toward green buildings encouraged us to train Johanna Hendricks to become a *US Green Building Council LEED® Accredited Professional*.  She is available as a resource to your team at any time.  Master Klean helped Colorado’s first LEED-EB Gold Certified Building, Denver Place, develop their green cleaning program; and were awarded several more LEED Certified facilities based on our expertise.

Again, thank you for your time and I look forward to meeting you.

The ISEM Team:

Dr. Jayesh M Mehta, MBA. Founder, President – ISEM, LLC:
Upon graduation, from IIT, Chicago Dr. Mehta joined GEAE, where he was responsible for several of the combustor/augmenter technology programs including Phase I of the NASA HSCT, and a program manager on two Navy initiatives on combustion instability. Between 1993 and 2009, Dr. Mehta has been a key technical lead on a variety of gas turbine technology development programs through DiversiTech, Inc. and TK Engineering Inc. These have included NASA/DOD Phase I and Phase II SBIRs on VFX fan and TVC combustor technologies, as well as Phase I SBIR program on active tip clearance. In addition, Dr. Mehta has also led CFX based CFD efforts on Phase I and Phase II programs that focused on developing an innovative rotating seal, and has contributed to other SBIR programs aimed at developing innovative UAV compressor, combustor (TVC based), and turbine technologies. In addition to significant experience in computational combustion, Dr. Mehta has also led efforts that involved turbine blade film cooling, as well as design and analysis of combustor rigs. Turbine aero and cooling has also been another area of expertise, where Dr. Mehta has contributed. These include, blade film cooling, S1 shroud cooling, as well as GE90 S1 nozzle cooling. Variable Turbine Nozzle has also been another area, in which Dr. Mehta has been instrumental in developing some innovative fluidics concepts.

UltraTech was formed in 1993 with one goal in mind: to create the world’s finest offering of environmental protection and hazardous materials management systems, including spill containment and spill response products. Since then, its vision has expanded into additional product categories and the company now features a product line that consists of over 300 unique products.

Its lines of “problem solver” products are market leaders in the following categories:
•	Spill Containment
•	Stormwater Management
•	Facility Protection
•	Construction Compliance
•	Oil Spill
•	Microbes
•	Rad Waste Management

The Spill Containment product line is the most extensive in the world. Using molded polyethylene, polyurethane and polymer-coated fabrics as the primary materials of choice, these “secondary containment” products are engineered to capture hazardous material spills from a wide variety of vessels, including laboratory bottles, drums, IBC tanks, stationary tanks, machinery, tanker trucks and railcars.

The Stormwater Management product line features an array of products designed to filter contaminants (i.e. sediment, oil and chemicals) from Stormwater runoff, stop hazardous spills from entering storm drains and to protect drums and tanks from outdoor elements.

The Facility Protection product line is comprised of many practical products that are designed to protect facility structures and grounds. Various items protect walls, I-beams, etc., against physical damage while others protect against damage caused by uncontrolled fluid flow including water, chemicals and oil. The product line helps reduce maintenance costs while enhancing the appearance of a facility overall.

The Construction Compliance product line consists of a complete line of erosion control, Stormwater management and spill containment products. The products are user-friendly and cost-effective, and allow a general contractor or site developer to “one stop shop” their needs

The CRC reaches out to and engages these individuals through programming in its energy, water, and waste divisions:

CRC’s Energy Division promotes energy conservation, energy efficiency and renewable energy. This includes residential energy advising, hosting educational seminars, and organizing the annual Boulder County Tour of Sustainable Homes. The energy division’s ReNew Our Schools program promotes energy education and conservation in local schools, granting solar electric systems to select schools each year.

CRC’s Water Division helps residents and businesses reduce water consumption by encouraging the efficient use of water. The Slow the Flow Colorado Program offers free sprinkler inspections and indoor water evaluations to customers of partner water providers. The Garden-In-A-Box Program sells professionally-designed, pre-planned xeric gardens to make xeriscaping easy. Free Water-Wise Landscape Seminars in April cover xeriscaping and sustainable landscaping topics.  Each year, the xeric garden program helps to convert 40,000 square feet of high-water-use landscape to xeriscape.

Promoting waste reduction through innovative landfill diversion programs, ReSource sells these reclaimed materials at 50%–90% below retail cost. Both ReSource Yards serve as drop-off locations for homeowners and contractors. Located in Boulder, the ReSource Tool Library is open daily and lets members borrow from a diverse tool inventory at affordable rates. The ReSource Tool Library also offers Tool School classes.

The reason being, Infineta offers the first technology specifically designed for inter-data center workflows such as replication, long distance ‘live’ migrations, massive file transfers and Big Data. I understand a strategic goal of the DOE is to strengthen the enterprise network and wanted to share this product in case you are in the midst of identifying and/or adopting new IT.

This technology has significant potential to increase NREL data center capabilities through its ease of scalability and 100% sustained use of WAN links. We have already begun to work with other DoD groups due to the sheer fact that with Infineta, customers can instantly support unprecedented traffic growth without WAN upgrades, leading to significant savings in both CAPEX (WAN equipment upgrades) and OPEX (incremental bandwidth costs).
 
Depending upon evaluation, and if you are interested in what Infineta could do for NREL, we would be more than happy to provide a presentation or WebEx in which we could demo the product to give a more clear picture of its benefits.

In 2008, there were only 22 registered energy raters in the entire state of Colorado on Colorado’s Estar website. Energy raters use HERS rating energy modeling software to evaluate how a pre built residential home will consume fossil fuel energy. Which is different than energy auditing , which evaluate energy loss/consumption of an existing home. 
Energy Auditing was in its infancy in 2008, and the non-profit “Center for Resource Conservation” in Boulder, CO offered its citizens, subsidized energy audits. The problem was, once the audit report was given to the home owner and all the recommendations that follow, no company existed to actually perform the work. Thus the niche to exploit and the creation of Advanced Air Sealing LLC came to be.


Advanced Air Sealing realizes there are additional choices in having the work completed. The experience and knowledge our company provides for this particular kind of work, is second best to none. 
  
Our Standards of practice are based on BPI and Home Performance W Energy Star for new-builds and existing residential construction.  This check list covers over 22 thermal bypasses typically created during the building of platform framed homes.  

According to the Department of Energy, the average American home leaks 60% of its air per hour.  The inefficiency is not the result of poorly insulated attics and walls, but escaping “conditioned air” resulting in the largest waste.  The work proposed, will not only add considerable comfort to your home but should reduce your annual energy bills (electric & gas) by 18 to 25 percent.   

The Advanced Air Sealing crew understands the importance of treating the customer and the customer’s home with respect and courtesy.  We take care in meeting special instructions while working in your home.   

Feel free to contact us with additional questions or set up a project start date.  You may reach us at 303.587.9493 or email- Airseal@comcast.net or website www.thisairsealedhome.com  If you plan to hire Advanced Air Sealing, please read, sign and return the Service Agreement that accompanies the email. We look forward to speaking with you soon.

My name is Kurtis Edwards.  I am an 11 year veteran of the Canadian Forces and have a small business by the name of Easy Energy Solutions, dealing with alternative fuels such as bio-diesel, ethanol, hydrogen, etc...

I have been looking into manufacturing solar panels, and have built the necessary equipment to start manufacturing.  Being that there are only two other companies in Canada that manufacture panels and that in order to qualify for the micro-fit program here in Canada; consumers must purchase panels manufactured locally, there is little competition.

Searching for a cost effective source of solar cells, I came across the following Internet post:  http://cleantechnica.com/2012/12/30/solar-pv-efficiency-record-broken-now-44-thanks-to-nrel-solar-junction/

I am hoping that there may be some way of doing business.  My business partner Brian Weisflock, owner of Shell Aviation in North Bay Ontario Canada, owns his own warehouse which we intend to run the manufacturing facility from.

KMPower Consulting is a small, woman-owned environmental consulting firm incorporated in 2004.  Clients have included the Bureau of Reclamation and the Department of the Interior's Office of Environmental Policy and Compliance (OEPC).  I am intrigued with the NREL's Net Zero Energy program.  I have read NREL's Net Zero Energy Military Installations: A Guide to Assessment and Planning and find NREL's approach of base-lining, identifying key data, energy efficiency assessments, and project recommendations similar to the process I used at DOI's OEPC to identify program inefficiencies and implement systems to improve their programs. If an opportunity exists for me to get involved with this NREL program, I would find that very professionally rewarding.

Jewell Ave,Suite #105,Denver,CO,80222,3035719317,,frank@redteamusa.com,http://www.redteamusa.com,0,2013-09-17 00:00:00.0000000,2013-06-24 00:00:00.0000000,"Red Team USA, Inc, was formed by two seasoned computer specialists: Nick Krut and Frank Hare.  At a time in their lives when most folks look to retiring schemes, Krut and Hare’s scheme is to help small companies protect themselves from cyber criminals.  

To start, Hare and Krut spent two-years researching, “why there are chronic levels of virus and malware attacks on professional client networks and personal computers.”  Unfortunately, the solutions they sought could not be found through industry-standard antivirus mechanisms and channels, in and of themselves. 

As engineers, Hare and Krut realized that they had to either discover and/or create out-of-the-box solutions.  Over a 3-year time period, they developed a process to help protect computers from cyber intrusions initiated by cyber criminals.  Their 4th year of scientific cyber protection research involved the implementation of their processes on select clients from their existing client bases, and “eureka”, the protection system worked as expected: a new, well-needed, cyber security service was born.

Hare and Krut then incorporated Red Team USA, Inc, in 2010, with a mission statement, “to help provide the highest cyber crime protection for businesses and individuals at the least possible cost”.

Krut and Hare recognized that the small business could not afford the same level of cyber security expense as the Fortune 500 companies.  Still, though, small businesses do need the same level of protection as the large companies.  So, they designed a system that resulted in a unique pay-by-subscription model.  The subscription service enables Red Team USA to offer “enterprise-type” IT security protection to small companies (1-to-100 workstations) for far, far less.  Red Team USA’s daily cost-per-computer workstation starts for less than what a cup of coffee per day can be. 

This is how the Red Team USA cyber security process works: 1) a cyber security vulnerability test and an assessment are performed on a prospect’s internet/network; 2) these tests reveal the weaknesses (holes) in a personal computer or network, and indicate to Red Team USA’s technicians what level of protection is needed; 3) Red Team USA then designs and implements its proprietary and customized cyber protection on a “per-computer workstation-per-day” subscription basis; 4) Red Team USA then provides ongoing “perimeter” Guardian-type intrusion detection/protection services between the internet and the client’s local network; 5) alerts about cyber intrusion issues can be sent to the client upon unusual cyber activity (or intrusion impact), as well as a comprehensive monthly report and suggested resolutions, if any.

Red Team USA is continually updated about cyber-threat prevention through its membership with resources as the Information Systems Security Assn (ISSA), the F.B.I’s Cyber Security partnership, Infragard.



 

Krut and Hare’s relentless research innovation and hard work has led Red Team USA to be Colorado’s premier and only proactive Cyber Security Resource (MSSP) that offers cyber security protection on a subscription basis. 

Red Team USA is a recommended Veteran-owned vendor and Cyber Security Company.  Red Team USA’s Security Policy does not allow Red Team USA to divulge its partner or its client list, but clients include artists, engineering firms, CPA networks, law offices, retailers, a building management company and Aerospace Manufacturer. 

Red Team USA is continually expanding its exploration about how to best serve its clients.  In 2011 Red Team USA created a Cyber Security Consortium of leading Cyber Security Practitioners to provide unparalleled services that are critical to maintain a Cyber-secure environment.

Dear Sir or Madame:

I am an exceptional power electronics specialist looking for a new business relationship.  I have invented converter circuits that offer advantages in both size and efficiency.  If you want to produce products with higher power density and higher efficiency than any products currently commercially available, higher reliability products with added value that will give your company a competitive advantage over the rest of the industry, then we should talk.  I am also open to other new business opportunities including power converter product design and development, trouble shooting, consulting and advising, and in-house technical seminars.  Let me know how I can help you.

About me:  I have 31 issued patents and several others pending.  One of my areas of expertise where I feel that I am uniquely qualified in the industry is in the area of topology selection and design trade off decision making.  If there is one area that I have found in which the top industry experts often get it wrong it is the area of topology selection and design trade off decision making.  Other areas of exceptional expertise include high density and high efficiency power supply design, soft switching (also known as Zero Voltage Switching (ZVS)) technology, both isolated and non-isolated solid state lighting applications, and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC).  I have taught many seminars at the Applied Power Electronics Conference and the Power Systems World Conference, most of which were the highest attended seminars and three of which were standing room only.  My seminar topics included gate driver design, soft switching power converters, high efficiency design, and EMC for power supplies.  I have published many conference papers, a series of articles in Power Electronics Technology (PET) magazine on EMC for power conversion and another article series in PET magazine on numerical topology selection which describes a mathematical model I developed for comparing and scoring circuit topologies so that a designer can choose the optimal topology for a given application, based on the operating conditions.  One of my recent inventions describes circuits intended for minimum size solid state lighting which can achieve power factor correction and simultaneously drive multiple independently regulated LED strings using a single magnetic circuit element. I have also designed an integrated circuit (IC) gate driver for SiC VJFETs and SiC bipolar transistors (AAC611 by ASIC Advantage, Inc. (AAI).  AAI is now part of Microsemi), which includes driver, control, and configuration circuits and a switching power supply that generates both positive and negative drive voltages from a single positive power source using only the IC and a few external components which includes a small single winding inductor.  My most recent work has focused on achieving low cost power converters with higher density and higher efficiency than any products currently available for DC/DC applications and for AC/DC applications with and without power factor correction (PFC).  Some of the soft switching circuits I have invented can achieve lower conduction losses, elimination of drain circuit switching losses, low parts count, reduced magnetic circuit element size and cost, and EMC advantages compared to the best circuits commercially available today.  My first patent, now expired, is in widespread use commercially.  That patent revealed a flyback converter that could achieve zero voltage switching (ZVS) without the large conduction losses of the prior invention which required reversal of magnetizing current to achieve ZVS.  My invention could achieve ZVS without incurring large conduction losses because it did not require that the magnetizing current be reversed in order to achieve ZVS.

As a renowned energy laboratory, we request a partnership on transitioning our game-changing microgrid-based prototype to scalable sizes for both military and civil applications. 

We require a qualified tech transfer office and lab to assist our minority-owned company with the tech-to-market process of our 340W 576Wh mobile microgrid.

Currently, we have a working desktop model of a Self-Contained, Air-to-Electricity Mobile Microgrid that utilizes only $.05 per kwh of electricity during its isothermal-based (rather than convention toxic-based combustible) conversion phase. The genius lies in the ability of dropping it anywhere to generate electricity and store both 0-emission heat and electricity simultaneously. The mobile microgrid utilizes storable, surrounding resources to generate and store electricity anytime onsite. 

We would like a partnership to scale to size the portable system for multiple military and civilian applications, including handheld, outdoor, residential, commercial, industrial, regional and electric vehicle power applications.  Our 21st century world can be energized by the Power of Air, while we create jobs and profit through cheaper power purchasing agreements with utilities, the sale of $.05 per kwh generation usage fee, and leasing fees.   

Please visit our website for more info, including pictures and videos. Thank you and we look forward to your reply. 

Best regards,
