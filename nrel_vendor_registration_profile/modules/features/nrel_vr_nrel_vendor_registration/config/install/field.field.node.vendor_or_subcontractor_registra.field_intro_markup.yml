Also important to the laboratory are partnerships with suppliers that result in creative collaboration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NREL's supplier management strategy is to work with businesses that improve the laboratory's competitive position and support the laboratory's mission.

NREL's diversity efforts are further supported by business development efforts through effective use of technical conferences, industry trade fairs, and minority business exchanges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To register to become an NREL vendor or subcontractor, complete the on-line registration form below.
